                        <p> We practice Natural Horsemanship Training on all of our horses.

                            We train the horse to THINK instead of just REACT.
                                
                            And we LOVE doing it all BAREFOOT!

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We produce barefoot and keg and lite shod pleasure horses with extensive traveling, camping and trail experience.  (This is our lifestyle and we travel a lot, training our own riding horses and then selling them, starting all over with a less experienced horse and polishing it.)
                        </p>

                        <p> We raise them, we buy some, polish and resell, and we take consignments.  We sell quality weanlings, yearlings, brood stock, trail horses and a few which have crossed from the trail to the show ring with great success.</p>
